Medusa, in Greek mythology, the most famous of the three monster figures known as Gorgons.
The three Gorgon sisters were Medusa, Stheno, and Euryale.
They were all children of the ancient marine deities Phorcys and his sister Ceto. 
Medusa was represented as a winged female creature having a head of hair consisting of snakes.
Unlike the Gorgons, she was sometimes represented as very beautiful.
She was the only Gorgon who was mortal.
Hence her slayer, Perseus, was able to kill her by cutting off her head.
He did it while looking at the reflection from the mirrored shield he received from Athena. 
From the blood that spurted from her neck sprang Chrysaor and Pegasus, her two sons by Poseidon. 
Heracles is said to have obtained a lock of Medusaâ€™s hair from Athena.
The lock possessed the same powers as the head.
He gave it to Sterope as a protection for the town of Tegea against attack.
When exposed to view, the lock was supposed to bring on a storm, which put the enemy to flight.
